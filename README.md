# Huffman-Coding
Huffman lossless data compression.

GENERAL FLOW OF PROGRAM.

Firstly, we read the file in the string.then we convert the data into their respective ASCII
then we declare an int array of 256. 256 because we are dealing with 8 - bit numbers and the maximum number of character we can get is 255.
every time a character occur we go to their ASCII and increment one in that array.
After this process ends the frequencies array have the frequencies of occurring character.
The next step is basically building a heap tree.in this step, 
we make sure that the most occur characters have lesser number of bits in order to get good compression. 
Now next stage is getting the codes of char generated by a tree.These code are made by traversing the tree until a character is found.
next thing is traversing the input file and placing the codes of the character into another file called huffman.txt
